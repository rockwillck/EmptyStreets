		<h2>Human Trafficking</h2>
		<p>“Trafficking in persons,” “human trafficking,” and “modern slavery” are umbrella terms – often used interchangeably – to refer to a crime whereby traffickers exploit and profit at the expense of adults or children by compelling them to perform labor or engage in commercial sex.  When a person younger than 18 is used to perform a commercial sex act, it is a crime regardless of whether there is any force, fraud, or coercion involved.</p>

		<h2>Who Are We?</h2>
		<p>Empty Streets is a youth-led 501c3 registered non-profit organization helping make an impact for survivors of human trafficking in the Houston Area.</p>
		<p>We organize awareness activities to educate communities while also supplying victims/survivors with donations, cards, care packages, and more.</p>
		<p>We also host fundraisers year-long, create informational social media posts, and collaborate with other youth-led organizations and NGOs to share knowledge, resources, and best practices in avoiding human trafficking.</p>
		<p>JOIN US TO MAKE A CHANGE!</p>
		<h2>The Problem</h2>
		<p>Despite Houston holding the unfortunate #1 ranking for human trafficking, there is only ONE functional shelter available for survivors. Empty Streets is a non-profit organization dedicated to helping these survivors today.</p>
		<h2>The Mission</h2>
		<p>We donate clothes, food, and essential products directly to the shelters, providing them with the crucial support they desperately need.</p>
		<p>We are living in the most dangerous city in the entire nation for human trafficking.</p>
		<h2>DONATE!</h2>
		<p>Donating is one of the biggest ways you can help our cause. Your donation is distributed between the following categories: buying toiletries and stationery for making C4K care packages, and expenses for other awareness events/fundraisers. If you would like your donation to go toward a specific category, make sure to let us know!</p>
