		<h2>Human Trafficking</h2>
		<p>“Trafficking in persons,” “human trafficking,” and “modern slavery” are umbrella terms – often used interchangeably – to refer to a crime whereby traffickers exploit and profit at the expense of adults or children by compelling them to perform labor or engage in commercial sex.  When a person younger than 18 is used to perform a commercial sex act, it is a crime regardless of whether there is any force, fraud, or coercion involved.</p>

		<h2>The Problem</h2>
		<p>Despite Houston holding the unfortunate #1 ranking for human trafficking, there is only ONE functional shelter available for survivors. Empty Streets is a non-profit organization dedicated to helping these survivors today.</p>
		<h2>The Mission</h2>
		<p>We donate clothes, food, and essential products directly to the shelters, providing them with the crucial support they desperately need.</p>
		<p>We are living in the most dangerous city in the entire nation for human trafficking.</p>
