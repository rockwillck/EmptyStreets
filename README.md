## Prompt
The organization wanted a blue-themed website (blue is the color of human-trafficking awareness) that could serve as their information hub across their different branches and track their fundraising progress.

## Implementation
When implementing the organization's design ideas, we faced difficulties with making a blue website that looked good. We eventually settled on this off-blue monotone look that still conveys a professional and modern approach to design.  

We use a combination of serif fonts and dot-matrix fonts (perhaps in a nod to Nothing's design language), along with very blocky design language and consistent templating throughout.  

The live fundraising is tracked through a google sheet, so we pull data from Google Sheet's publish-to-web feature.
