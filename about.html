		<h2>Mission Statement</h2>
		<p>Empty Streets is dedicated to supporting survivors of human trafficking in Houston, which is currently ranked as the top city in the nation for such issues.</p>
		<h2>Fundraising</h2>
		<p>We raise funds by going door-to-door and selling baked goods.</p>
		<h2>Landing Drop-In Center</h2>
		<p>We have directly coordinated with the donation manager at The Landing Drop-In Center in Houston to identify their most urgent needs. After purchasing the required items, we deliver them directly to their facility.</p>
