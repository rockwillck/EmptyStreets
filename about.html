		<h2>Mission Statement</h2>
		<p>Empty Streets is dedicated to supporting survivors of human trafficking in Houston, which is currently ranked as the top city in the nation for such issues.</p>
		<h2>Fundraising</h2>
		<p>We raise funds by going door-to-door and selling baked goods.</p>
		<h2>Landing Drop-In Center</h2>
		<p>We have directly coordinated with the donation manager at The Landing Drop-In Center in Houston to identify their most urgent needs. After purchasing the required items, we deliver them directly to their facility.</p>
		<h2>Branching Out</h2>
		<p>We are currently expanding our outreach to schools across the Houston area to raise funds and awareness for survivors of human trafficking. Many schools do not educate their students about this critical issue, and we believe it is essential to highlight that human trafficking is a serious and ongoing problemâ€”often referred to as "modern slavery." Through our Empty Streets initiative, we aim to inform students about the realities of human trafficking today, rather than focusing solely on historical forms of slavery.</p>
